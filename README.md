# EndpointSecurityAgent

## Project scope

### 1. Agent Architecture:

   - **Core Service**: This is the main process that runs in the background, monitoring system activity.
   - **Configuration Module**: Manages the configuration settings for the agent (e.g., policies, monitoring intervals).
   - **Communication Module**: Handles communication with a central server, if any, for updates, logging, and alerts.
   - **Plugins/Modules**: Modular components that monitor specific aspects of the system (e.g., file system, network activity).


### 2. Features:
   File Integrity Monitoring:

   Monitor specific directories or files for changes using file hashing.
   Trigger alerts on unauthorized changes.
   Go libraries to consider: crypto/sha256 for hashing, os for file operations.

#### Process Monitoring:

    Continuously monitor running processes.
    Detect and alert on suspicious or unauthorized processes.
    Go libraries to consider: os/exec for process listings.

#### Network Monitoring:

    Monitor outgoing and incoming network connections.
    Detect connections to known malicious IPs or unusual traffic patterns.
    Go libraries to consider: net for network operations.

#### Log Monitoring:

    Monitor system logs for suspicious entries.
    Go libraries to consider: native file reading capabilities or third-party log parsing libraries.

#### System Health Check:

    Monitor CPU, memory, disk space, and other system metrics.
    Alert if metrics cross certain thresholds.
    Go libraries to consider: runtime for basic metrics, or third-party libraries for detailed system monitoring.

### 3. Alerting:

   Generate alerts for detected anomalies or policy violations.
   Send alerts to a central server, log them locally, or even send them via email or other communication methods.

### 4. Updates:

   The agent should be able to receive updates for configurations, threat intelligence, or even binary updates.
   Implement a secure mechanism for updates to ensure the agent isn't compromised via this vector.

### 5. Security:

   Ensure the agent itself is secure. Consider encrypting sensitive data.
   Regularly audit the code and consider penetration testing.
   Use Go's native capabilities for secure communications (e.g., crypto/tls).

### 6. Deployment & Management:

   The agent should be easy to deploy across multiple machines.
   Consider a command & control (C2) server for centralized management, configuration, and updates.

### 7. Cross-Platform Support:

   One of the challenges with endpoint agents is supporting multiple OSes.
   Design your agent to be modular to support different OS-specific monitoring modules.

### Challenges:

    Performance: The agent should have minimal impact on system performance.
    Stealth: Malicious actors may attempt to detect or disable the agent.
    False Positives: Ensure the agent doesn't generate excessive false alerts, which can lead to alert fatigue.
